## Hello fellow code reader! 🙂

- 🛠️ I’m currently working on a rust-based lightweight yet comprehensive WHMCS equivalent tailored to my needs. ✨
- 🌅 I’m learning software cybersecurity during the day for my studies as a software cybersecurity engineer.
- 🌃 And I'm writing 🦀Rust during the night at the cost of my sanity.
- 💖 My favorite topics include : Software architecture, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Decentralization.
- 💔 Fun fact: I have a love hate relationship with Python, I feel like Python is always coming back to haunt me.

Take care of your work instruments (🧠, 👀, 👐) and yourself so you can be the best 💪 and enjoy life ❤️.
Wish you the best !
